            label:

            1. At most 63 characters in length
            2. It must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or
               ``-``
            3. It must start and end with an alphanumeric character

            Which can be expressed as the regex:

            Optional. GCP labels for this membership.
        description (str):
            Optional. Description of this membership, limited to 63
            characters. Must match the regex:

        external_id (str):
            Optional. An externally-generated and managed ID for this
            Membership. This ID may be modified after creation, but this
            is not recommended. For GKE clusters, external_id is managed
            by the Hub API and updates will be ignored.

            The ID must match the regex:

            If this Membership represents a Kubernetes cluster, this

            established with Google Cloud. This time is
            updated every several minutes, not continuously.
            For clusters that do not use GKE Connect, or
            that have never connected successfully, this
            field will be unset.
        unique_id (str):
            Output only. Google-generated UUID for this resource. This
            is unique across all Membership resources. If a Membership
            resource is deleted and another resource with the same name

    this Membership. See the workload identity documentation for
    more details:
    https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity

    Attributes:
        issuer (str):
            Optional. A JSON Web Token (JWT) issuer URI. ``issuer`` must
            start with ``https://`` and be a valid URL with length <2000
            characters.

            If set, then Google will allow valid OIDC tokens from this
            issuer to authenticate within the workload_identity_pool.
            OIDC discovery will be performed on this URI to validate
            tokens from the issuer.

            Clearing ``issuer`` disables Workload Identity. ``issuer``
            cannot be directly modified; it must be cleared (and
            Workload Identity disabled) before using a new issuer (and
            re-enabling Workload Identity).
        workload_identity_pool (str):
            Output only. The name of the workload identity pool in which
            ``issuer`` will be recognized.

            There is a single Workload Identity Pool per Hub that is
            shared between all Memberships that belong to that Hub. For
            a Hub hosted in {PROJECT_ID}, the workload pool format is
            ``{PROJECT_ID}.hub.id.goog``, although this is subject to
            change in newer versions of this API.
        identity_provider (str):
            Output only. An identity provider that reflects the
            ``issuer`` in the workload identity pool.
        oidc_jwks (bytes):
            Optional. OIDC verification keys for this Membership in JWKS
            format (RFC 7517).

            When this field is set, OIDC discovery will NOT be performed
            on ``issuer``, and instead OIDC tokens will be validated
            using this field.
